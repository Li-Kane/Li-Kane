# Hello, my Name's Kane ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 2nd Year Computer Science Major at UC San Diego interested in learning and developing the skills to design elegant solutions to real-world problems. Current interests include software engineering and robotics.

## Current Projects
- [Engineers for Exploration:](https://github.com/UCSD-E4E/MMICT) Developing a web application to assist environmental research by classifying mangrove regions in uploaded drone imagery. My role has revolved around setting up user-authentication through Auth0, setting up API endpoints to access and update our MongoDB database and AWS account, and occasional frontend styling. 
- [Triton Robotics:](https://github.com/Triton-Robotics/TR-CV-2024.git) Establishing communication between the Computer Vision team and Embedded team (Jetson to STM32) using UART communication. Also developed a Kalman filtering test program for future implementation.

## Favorite Projects
- [Dougu Mobile App:](https://github.com/Li-Kane/Dougu) Pushed a mobile app to internal testing on both Google Play Console and Apple Testflight as part of a process of devloping an equipment management app that seeks to make transferring and keeping track of equipment as simple as possible. With designs from [Neela Kolte.](https://www.behance.net/neelakolte). Built using React Native and AWS Amplify for the backend, the app is currently under testing and planning with an intended release date in the summer.
- [CMNIST Website:](https://cmnist-website.vercel.app/) Created a website hosting a neural network which allows users to draw Chinese characters and a custom trained model will predict which class it is. It was a fun project on my own to explore how neural networks can be trained and integrated into real-life web applications.
- [Asayake Taiko Website:](https://asayaketaiko.ucsd.edu/) An imagined tkae of how I would build a website for Asayake Taiko, a Japanese ensemble drumming club. This was mainly intended for frontend practice, and I also deployed the official website using an Alumni's design to the UC San Diego remote server.
