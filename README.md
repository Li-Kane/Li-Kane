# Hello, my Name's Kane ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 3rd Year Computer Science Major at UC San Diego interested in learning and developing the skills to design elegant solutions to real-world problems. Current interests include robotics and embedded systems.

## Current Projects
- [Triton Robotics:](https://github.com/Triton-Robotics/TR-CV-2024.git) Leading the autonomy team to control an robot to autonomous aim towards other robots and fire at them while moving around. Projects of mine include setting up team coding conventions, creating a pybullet simulation environment, setting up a UART communication protocol, and testing a kalman filtering algorithm.
- [Dougu Mobile App:](https://github.com/Li-Kane/Dougu) Pushed a mobile app to internal testing on both Google Play Console and Apple Testflight as part of a process of devloping an equipment management app that seeks to make transferring and keeping track of equipment as simple as possible. With designs from [Neela Kolte](https://www.behance.net/neelakolte). Built using React Native and AWS Amplify for the backend, the app is currently under a closed release and testing in preparation for an app store release.
- [DiffCo:](https://github.com/ucsdarclab/diffco.git) Helping to test this collision checking library across a variety of simulation environments to ensure code reliability and robustness. Currently, I am working on implementing DiffCo in ManiSkill.

## Past Projects
- [Engineers for Exploration:](https://github.com/UCSD-E4E/MMICT) Developing a web application to assist environmental research by classifying mangrove regions in uploaded drone imagery. My role has revolved around setting up user-authentication through Auth0, setting up API endpoints to access and update our MongoDB database and AWS account, and occasional frontend styling. 
- [CMNIST Website:](https://cmnist-website.vercel.app/) Created a website hosting a neural network which allows users to draw Chinese characters and a custom trained model will predict which class it is. It was a fun project on my own to explore how neural networks can be trained and integrated into real-life web applications.
- [Asayake Taiko Website:](https://asayaketaiko.ucsd.edu/) An imagined take of how I would build a website for Asayake Taiko, a Japanese ensemble drumming club. This was mainly intended for frontend practice, and I also deployed the official website using an Alumni's design to the UC San Diego remote server.
